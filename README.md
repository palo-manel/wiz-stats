## Running Locally

### Pre-requisites

To be able to run this manually you need to install the necessary pre-requisites.

```bash
pip install pandas jupyter
```

### Embededing in VS Code

VS Code provides native [support for Jupyter Notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) and lets you:

* Create, open, and save Jupyter Notebooks
* Work with Jupyter code cells
* View, inspect, and filter variables using the Variable Explorer and Data Viewer
* Connect to a remote Jupyter server
* Debug a Jupyter Notebook

So you'll just need to open this project in VS Code and interact with the Jupyter notebook as you would normally.
